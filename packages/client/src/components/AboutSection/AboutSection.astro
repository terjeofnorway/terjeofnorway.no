    <p>I'm a senior developer based in Oslo. I work as a consultant at Systek, building modern, resilient web experiences — with a passion for usability, accessibility, and all things geeky.<br/><br/>I'm pragmatic about tools. If it runs in a browser or on a server and makes people's lives better, I'm interested. I'm the kind of developer who reads the changelog, keeps an eye on web standards, and happily chats with users to understand their pains and gains.</p>
    <p>I believe tech should be inclusive, privacy-respecting, and human-centred. LGBTQ+ rights and diversity aren't just side notes — they're part of what makes teams (and the web) better.<br/><br/>Outside work, I lift weights, care for my plants, and take our greyhound for long walksies.<br/><br/>I like to fiddle with side projects — some that actually get finished, and some that quietly die halfway through.<br/><br/>Basically, I'm always building something — sometimes it even works.</p>
